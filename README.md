## Repository Introduction
[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) is written purely in C/C++ without any external dependencies, delivering optimal performance and cross-platform compatibility that runs smoothly from embedded devices to high-performance servers.

Specially optimized for large language model inference, it supports quantization techniques and hardware acceleration, significantly reducing memory usage and computational costs while maintaining model quality.

Supports multiple hardware platforms including CPU, GPU (CUDA, OpenCL, Metal), and is compatible with operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux to meet various deployment needs.<br>
This product is provided as a pre-installed image on Huawei Cloud's HCE2.0 system (Kunpeng architecture).

This project provides the open-source image product [**llama.cpp Inference Framework**](?????), which comes pre-installed with the llama.cpp inference framework and its related runtime environment, along with deployment templates. Follow the usage guide to easily enjoy an "out-of-the-box" efficient experience.

> **System Requirements:**
> - CPU: 2vCPUs or higher
> - RAM: 4GB or more
> - Disk: At least 40GB
